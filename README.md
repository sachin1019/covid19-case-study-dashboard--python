# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis (Python)

An **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of global COVID-19 data using **Python**.  
This project covers 15+ analytical questions including monthly trends, death and recovery ratios, and country-wise progression to uncover insights into the pandemic’s global impact.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Concepts:** Data Cleaning, Transformation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Time-Series Analysis, Data Visualization  

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Identify countries with the highest confirmed and death cases  
- Compare recovery and death rates across nations  
- Analyze monthly trends in the **US, Canada, and Europe**  
- Merge and transform datasets for a unified pandemic view

## 🧠 Key Insights from COVID-19 Analysis

- **Highest total confirmed cases:** *United States, India, Brazil*  
- **China:** Striking early increase followed by a diminishing growth rate after the initial outbreak period.  
- **Single-day surge (Europe):** *France* recorded the highest single-day surge among Germany, France, and Italy.  
- **Canada vs Australia:** Canada showed better pandemic management metrics relative to Australia in the dataset.  

### 🩸 Death Rate Distribution (Canada)
- **Lowest:** Grand Princess *(as computed in the dataset)*  
- **Highest:** Quebec *(as of the latest available date)*  

### ⚰️ Top 5 Countries by Average Daily Deaths
United States, Brazil, India, Mexico, Italy  

### 📈 US Death Evolution
- Total deaths increased steadily, peaking around **May 2021**.  

### 🌍 Highest Average Death Rates (2020)
- *Yemen, MS Zaandam, Vanuatu*  

### 🇿🇦 South Africa — Recoveries vs Deaths
- **Total Recoveries:** 310,037,573  
- **Total Deaths:** 10,250,036  
- **Interpretation:** The scale of recoveries vs deaths shows a strong positive recovery outcome among recorded cases *(see notebook for details).*  

### 🇺🇸 US Recovery Rate
- Highest recovery rate observed in **October 2020** (as per dataset).
